# XR/SDK

Self-hosting toolchain for the XR/station and Fox32 platforms.

Features a self-hosting compiler for the Jackal language, an assembler, a linker, and a multi-threaded build tool; all written in Jackal. These tools can run on any little-endian platform that has a C compiler, and also on the XR/17032 and Fox32 architectures.

## Structure

```
Cf/               - Common Frontend code shared between the tools.
Library/          - Common library code shared between the tools.
Rtl/              - Common native runtime code.
XrAsm/            - Assembler.
Jackal/           - Jackal compiler.
XrLink/           - Linker.
XrBuildTool/      - Build system.
XrDiskUpdateTool/ - Disk image management tool.
```

## Usage

To initially build the Jackal compiler, type `./bootstrap.sh` to cause the "precompiled" C files to be built into the initial compiler at `./bin/jkl.exe`. The custom build system will also be built at `./bin/xrbt.exe`.

Typing `./buildall.sh [desired multithread count]` will then do a "proper" build of all of the tools.

Subsequent compilations of the tools can be performed as:

```
./bin/xrbt.exe ./build.xrbt JOBS=[desired multithread count] [toolname]
```

Where toolname is one of the following choices:

```
Jackal           - The Jackal compiler.
XrBuildTool      - The build system.
XrAsm            - The assembler.
XrLink           - The linker.
XrDiskUpdateTool - The disk tool.
```

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Jackal -> C bootstrap transpiler.
- [x] Self-hosted Jackal compiler with C, Fox32, and XR/17032 backends.
- [x] Self-hosted build tool `xrbt` to replace `make`.
- [x] New generic assembler written in Jackal with XR/17032 and Fox32 support.
- [x] New linker written in Jackal with XR/17032 and Fox32 support.
- [x] Disk image creation and partitioning tool. Also with support for formatting, reading, and writing AisixFS.
- [x] `xrbt` support for automatically creating and updating rebuilt files in disk images if configured to do so.
- [ ] Complete rewrite of the MINTIA OS in Jackal.
- [ ] New middle-end and backends for the Jackal compiler, since those turned out suboptimal (it was my first time!).
